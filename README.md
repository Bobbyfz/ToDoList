# TodoList
File based Todo List written in C++
# Why did I create this?
When I write my to do list, I usually use a .txt file on my computer that I type on. I decided to turn this into a project by applying what I usually do and programming it
# What does it do?
This program writes a file to the working directory of the file and reads and writes specific tasks and is able to remove the task as well.
